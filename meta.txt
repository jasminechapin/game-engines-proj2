Much of the foundation for this project was taken from project 1 - breakout, including but not
limited to math, collisions, physics, logic, classes, level-loading, audio, and images.

We decided the component and physics systems from labs 7 and 8 would be a great foundation
to build on for milestone 2 and 3, so we essentially used lab 8 as starter code and built 
several custom objects and components from there.
